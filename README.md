# Project Title
Exploratory Data Analysis- House Price Prediction

# Description
For this project I took the EDA approach to analyze the House Price Prediction dataset to summarize the main
statistical characteristics of the dataset. To make sense of the numbers, multiple visualizations have been included.
After cleaning the data further, I dropped some variables and later used a heatmap to understand the relevant 
variables before ending the project with feature selection.

2. Visualization
3. Data Quality Report
4. Data Pre-processing
5. Post-Processing

# How to Run and Install Project
I used github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-Data/CA01 to install the dataset.
To run it, I mounted my google colab to my google drive using the
following code:
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/gdrive')

# How to Use the Project
To understand all the variables in the dataset and the distribution and spread
of each one, the visualizations in this dataset will be very helpful. The 
Data Quality Report section has all the reasoning behind how and why all variables with
missing values were handled. This project can also be used to see and understand
the relationship between each independent variable. This is a very useful baseline
for applying further statiscal techniques.


# Credits
Thie project was started and completed inpendently by me, however some of my
professor, Dr. Arin Brahma as well as some of my classmates- Abdul, Marissa
and Elstan helped guide me.
